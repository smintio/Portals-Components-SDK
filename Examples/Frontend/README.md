Examples for Smint.io Portals frontend components
================================================

This repository contains examples for Smint.io Portals frontend components (pages, UI components).

Please note that at any time you can build your own page template or UI componentc based
on our *Smint.io Portals SDKs*. Access to the SDKs is restricted. Get in contact with [Smint.io](https://www.smint.io)
and request access. Access will be granted to either Smint.io Solution Partners or to all our Smint.io Portals
Enterprise plan customers.

You will need an account with Microsoft Visual Studio cloud offerings (Azure DevOps), as the SDKs are hosted there.
