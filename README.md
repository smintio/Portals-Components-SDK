Description
===========

This repository contains examples and tools for rapid developing of custom components targeting the Smint.io Portals solution.

Examples cover both [frontend](Examples/Frontend/) and [backend](Examples/Backend/) components.

The tools we provide can improve the experience as you develop Smint.io Portals components.

- Data Adapter Exporter SDK is used to generate TypeScript public API interface definition from backend component assemblies. Learn more about how to do that [here](Examples/Backend/#custom-public-api-interfaces)
- Publish Component SDK is used to compile, package and deploy components. More on that [here](Tools/Portals-SDK-PublishComponent-CLI/Release/)

Please note that future tools may be added or existing ones may be updated based on user feedback.
