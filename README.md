Description
===========

This repository contains examples and tools for rapid developing of custom components targeting the Smint.io Portals solution.

Examples cover both [frontend](Examples/Frontend/) and [backend](Examples/Backend/) components.

The tools we provide can improve the experience as you develop Smint.io Portals components.

- The [Data Adapter Exporter SDK](https://github.com/smintio/Portals-Components-SDK/tree/main/Examples/Backend/#user-content-data-adapter-public-api-interfaces) is used to generate TypeScript public API interface definition from backend component assemblies
- The [Portals-SDK-PublishComponent-CLI tool](Tools/Portals-SDK-PublishComponent-CLI/Release/) is used to compile, package and deploy components
- The [Portals-DevServer](Tools/Portals-DevServer/Release/) is used for local distribution of frontend components

Please note that future tools may be added or existing ones may be updated based on user feedback.

Current version of this document is: 1.0.0 (as of 30th of November, 2022)
