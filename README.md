Description
===========

This repository contains examples and tools for rapid developing of custom components targeting the Smint.io portals solution.

[Examples](Examples/) cover both the [frontend](Examples/Frontend/) and [backend](Examples/Backend/) spectrum.

`Vue.js` is our choice for building user interfaces backed up by `.NET Core`.

The tools we provide can improve the experience as we develop components.

- Data adapter exporter SDK is used to generate TypeScript public API interface definition from backend component assembly. Learn more about how to do that [here](Examples/Backend/#custom-public-api-interfaces)
- Publish component SDK is used to compile, package and deploy components. More on that [here](Tools/Portals-SDK-PublishComponent-CLI/)

Please note that future tools may be added or existing ones may be updated based on customer feedback.
