Description
===========

This repository contains examples and tools for rapid developing of custom components targeting the Smint.io Portals solution.

Examples cover both [frontend](Examples/Frontend/) and [backend](Examples/Backend/) components.

The tools we provide can improve the experience as you develop Smint.io Portals components.

- The [Data Adapter Exporter SDK](https://github.com/smintio/Portals-Components-SDK/tree/main/Examples/Backend/#user-content-data-adapter-public-api-interfaces) is used to generate TypeScript public API interface definition from backend component assemblies
- The [Portals-SDK-PublishComponent-CLI tool](Tools/Portals-SDK-PublishComponent-CLI/Release/) is used to compile, package and deploy components

Please note that future tools may be added or existing ones may be updated based on user feedback.
